## My background
I was raised by my single mother since the age of 14, and now I am 23 years old.

My parents are different, specifically My mother got post secondary education whereas my father didn't.
After experience that communicate with colleagues who are under educated, I can strong feel that cultural factors play more significant role to shape their personality.
