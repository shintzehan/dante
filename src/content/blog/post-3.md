### Figure out pros and cons
After socialization, to deepen my awareness is crucial. Specifically to figure out my pros and cons.

My previous plan is to achieve status as Engineer that works in English, which is not clearly enough.
1) Engineering or English, which comes first?
2) What is Engineering, and what is English as working language.
3) How to distribute attention in engineering and language.

As far as one year after then, I can give my temporary answer now.
1) Engineering is the first, English is the tool to fulfill my Engineering career that spans multiple disciplines.
2) Engineering **must** refer for fields that needs hands-on, Reading books or view videos doesn't help, English is the tool to access international contents and GitHub.
3) I can't answer.

### Why can't give specific answer on the distribution of attention
Language is more important than I think after using LLMs for Engineering, to question is the crucial skill as an engineer.
As trilingual, I can feel that English and Japanese help me a lot in interact with LLMs.

### Before my 30s
I want to ensure accessibility to middle-high position in career, as specialist even professional.
- hold experience in both eecs disciplines is crucial, with prepared ability to self-taught
- hold master degree is an option
- oversea working experience is good, culture exchange is good
