### Socialization, maybe failed but valuable
My first steps to get into society is as field application engineer, as passive tasks' solver.
I was wish to be an engineer with English as working language, since my passion's about active learner rather than technician.

The valuable experience for me in previous year as FAE is about tired but socialized, I gradually understand how others think and act.
Socialization helps me identify problems and tasks, before that I was confused about which part of eecs to dive into, or maybe language learning to go first and then pursue master degree oversea.

### What I don't want before my 30s
I don't want to be leader or any form of person that arrange people with tasks, conduct with others are valuable in association but can't enhance ones garbling power when get pay by his / her time.

I don't want to keep in homogenous role (but not means to be the same occupation) for a long time, with repetitive practice can't truly enhance my productivity.

I don't want to connect with female, maybe after 30s too.

### What I want to obtain before my 30s
Healthy body, friend offline and serve as a profession in my domain (reputation).

Reading ability, which is truly valuable but rare in my class.

High paid position, or start own business(?).
