## What is CS: APP
I read the book of Computer System. A Programmer's Perspective since early 2022.

But after years I found that I lost lots of detailed memory I want to learn.
In this project I plan to re-organize my C language based computer system journey.

## Why CS: APP
This is the book I familiar and interested most, I want to prepare myself to understand how MCUs works via this project.

## Dates
Today is November 5<sup>th</sup>, I plan to use 3 days to initialize my project, and document experience in this article.

I plan to focus with former paragraphs that computer architecture, as well as I plan to learn Linux in another book.
