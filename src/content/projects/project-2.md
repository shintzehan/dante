## What is CS: APP
I read the book of Computer System. A Programmer's Perspective since early 2022.

But after years I found that I lost lots of detailed memory I want to learn.
In this project I plan to re-organize my C language based computer system journey.

## Why CS: APP
This is the book I familiar and interested most, I want to prepare myself to understand how MCUs works via this project.

## Problems
**BLANK**
