## How it starts
I want to launch my personal blog for a long time, I was using [hashnode](https://blog.shintzehan.com) as my "technical writing" site.

Like most of the tasks I've done before, I can't satisfy from know how to use tools, what I want is to understand how to create tools, with flexibility and efficiency.

## Jekyll
I use Jekyll before Astro, with zero code are needed a month ago.

Jekyll is good, but I lost my curiosity very much because I can't understand and don't want to learn Ruby.

Finally, I find Astro.

## Astro
Compare with Hugo or Hexo, Astro can provide me significant flexibility. I can't understand TypeScript and still not familiar with astro syntax, but as long as I can understand project structure and willing to learn node based frameworks, I finished blog deployment in 2 days.

Experience of failures are beneficial too, I learnt to use git and GitHub in these months, and my training of English reading helps me a lot since I keep asking claude for help.

Also, I realized that LLMs have their performance limitation, I can ask for help but the more it close to engineering, the more I can't rely on.
