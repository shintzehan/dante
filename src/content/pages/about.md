## Shin Tzehan - the Electrical and Computer Engineer

### Passions

My **Passion** is about math and physics, or computer science and electrical engineering.

I was major in Electrical Engineering, Signal and System are crucial for telecommunication and radio frequency design which involves mathematics tools like complex function: fourier Transform. I was attracted from S&S so much, lecturer advice me to read the origin text of [Oppenheim](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-6-007-signals-and-systems-spring-2011/).

Gradually I can read pure English text books, from basic circuitry to computer architecture at the year of 2022.

At early 2023, OpenAI released its large language model, I start to use the GPT at very beginning, since its English response speed is quicker than other languages, I kept to use English to interact with LLMs which enhanced my oral expression as well as listening.

### Career goals

I noticed my Asperger Syndrome during university, I am overwhelmed when conduct with others, social interaction challenging for me.

That is the crucial motivation I start my career as **field application engineer**. It's difficult, stressful but worth it.

I want to achieve high position like senior engineer and / or engineering manager, I plan to focus on enhance my "bargaining power" from skills and experience.
