## Shin Tzehan - the Electrical and Computer Engineer

### Engineer not Technician

I obtained my college degree of Bachelor in EE and CS in 2023, the reason I chose Field Application Engineer as my entry position is it involves massive conduction with people: internal and external.

Before make commitment on plans, I would prefer to figure out why and how, **Engineers** should be prepared to identify problems that might happen potentially, Rather than handle problems / tasks that constantly raised like **Technician**.

I love the experience serve as FAE during 2023 to 2024, I can understand how industry works from a macro perspective presently, but I shall not stop here.

### Passions

My **Passion** is about math and physics, or abstraction terms.

I was major in Electrical Engineering, Signal and System are crucial for telecommunication and radio frequency design which involves mathematics tools like complex function, Fourier Transform and more. I was attracted from S&S so much, lecturer advice me to read the origin text of [Oppenheim](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-6-007-signals-and-systems-spring-2011/).

Gradually I can read pure English text books, from basic circuitry to computer architecture at the year of 2022, although I am not maturer, there are my passions and I will be there one day.

At early 2023, OpenAI released its large language model, I start to use the GPT at very beginning, and its English response speed is much quickly than other languages, I keep to use English to interact with LLMs, Massive input and output enhanced my oral expression as well as listening.
And I'm using Claude and Gemini as prime LLMs presently.

### Career goals

I knew my Asperger Syndrome during university, I am overwhelmed when conduct with others, social interaction are big con for me (and maybe my families).

And that is the crucial motivation I start my career as field application engineer. It's challenging, stressful but worth it.

I want to achieve high positions like senior engineer and / or engineering manager, in early career I plan to focus on how to earn "bargaining power" from skills and experience.

## Detailed Experience
- Sept. 2019 to Jun. 2023 Dual Bachelor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Harbin University of Science and Technology
- Oct. 2023 to Mar. 2024 Colorlight, the main LED screen control system provider that the only IPO in that field
- Apr. 2024 to Jul. 2024 LR Opto-electronic, middle-sized LED screen manufacture, with advantages on COB (chip on board) technique, high-end focus.
